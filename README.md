# productos_app

A new Flutter project to improve my development skills with Flutter.

This application simulate a product store. Users can create, update and see the products in the database in realtime.

## Services

List of services used:

- **Firebase - Realtime Database.** To storage all information about products.
- **Firebase - Authentication.** To control authentication user.
- **Cloudinary** To upload product images.


## Implementations

At this point in the application development I've implemented:

- **Login Controller.** To validate all the inputs data in the form.
- **CRUD towards REST service.** Create, read and update products in Firebase. Also upload images to Cloudinary.
- **Camera and galery.** To take products photos.
- **Token handling.** To verify that users are logged in and can modify or create products in Firebase database.
- **Secure storage.** To store the user token.
