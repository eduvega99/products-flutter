# productos_app

A new Flutter project to improve my development skills with Flutter.

## Services

List of services used:

- **Firebase - Realtime Database.** To storage all information about products.
- **Cloudinary** To upload product images.


## Implementations

At this point in the application development I've implemented:

- **Login Controller.** To validate all the inputs data in the form.
- **CRUD towards REST service.** Create, read and update products in firebase. Also upload images to Cloudinary.
- **Camera and galery.** To take products photos.

## Next Steps

The next objectives are:

- Implement user authentication via firebase and use tokens in our services.
